# Project HeadBoard - Class Summary / Cheat Sheet

This document provides a quick reference guide for all classes in the Project HeadBoard Android app.

## Core Service & Accessibility

### `CursorAccessibilityService`

### `HeadBoardService` ⚠️ **UNUSED**
**Purpose**: Bound service providing low-latency bi-directional communication between the accessibility service and OpenBoard IME (keyboard).
- Handles motion events and key events from keyboard
- Manages callbacks for keyboard integration
- **Status**: Currently unused - declared in manifest but never started/bound in production code

- Receives swipe start events from OpenBoard
- Handles long press animations
- Processes keyboard state changes
- **Note**: Currently uses broadcast receivers, not AIDL

### AIDL Interfaces ⚠️ **UNUSED**
The following AIDL interfaces are defined but not used in production code:
- `IHeadBoardService.aidl` - Service interface for AIDL communication
- `IHeadBoardCallback.aidl` - Callback interface for service events
- `KeyInfo.aidl` - Data class for keyboard key information (Parcelable)
- `KeyBounds.aidl` - Data class for keyboard key bounds (Parcelable)

## Architecture Overview

```
MainActivity (Entry Point)
    ↓
CursorAccessibilityService (Background Service)
    ├── FaceLandmarkerHelper (Face Detection)
    ├── CursorController (Cursor Logic)
    ├── ServiceUiManager (UI Management)
    ├── KeyboardManager (Keyboard Integration)
    └── DispatchEventHelper (Event Routing)
        ↓
    BlendshapeEventTriggerConfig (Gesture Mapping)
    CursorMovementConfig (Movement Settings)

```

---

## Key Data Flow

1. **Face Detection**: Camera → `FaceLandmarkerHelper` → Face coordinates/blendshapes
2. **Cursor Movement**: Face coordinates → `CursorController` → Cursor position
3. **Event Triggers** (multiple input sources):
   - **Facial Gestures**: Blendshapes → `BlendshapeEventTriggerConfig` → Event type
   - **Bluetooth Switches**: Key events (KEYCODE_1, KEYCODE_2, KEYCODE_3, etc.) → `BlendshapeEventTriggerConfig` → Event type
   - **Other Input Sources**: Joysticks, keyboards, controllers, etc. (via KEY_EVENT trigger type)
   - **Internal Actions**: App logic can trigger events internally (INTERNAL trigger type)
   - **Note**: Some trigger types/actions are defined but not yet fully implemented
4. **Event Dispatch**: Event type → `DispatchEventHelper` → Accessibility gesture
5. **UI Update**: Cursor position → `ServiceUiManager` → `CursorView` update

## OpenBoard IME Integration

**OpenBoard** is a custom IME (Input Method Editor) keyboard located in the `openboard/` directory. It's designed to work alongside the main Project HeadBoard app for advanced head-controlled typing features.

### Integration Points

- **Purpose**: Provides real-time gesture typing and advanced keyboard features optimized for head-controlled input
- **Communication**: The main app communicates with OpenBoard via:
  - **Broadcast Receivers**: `KeyboardEventReceiver` receives events from OpenBoard (swipe start, long press animations, keyboard state changes)
  - **Broadcast Intents**: `KeyboardManager` sends motion events, key events, and UI updates to OpenBoard via broadcasts
  - **Package Name**: `org.dslul.openboard.inputmethod.latin`
- **Features**: 
  - Real-time gesture trail visualization
  - Custom key highlighting and popup management
  - Swipe gesture recognition optimized for head control
  - Long press delay configuration
  - Keyboard state synchronization

### Note
The OpenBoard codebase is separate and extensive. This summary focuses only on the main Project HeadBoard app and its integration points with OpenBoard, not the internal implementation of OpenBoard itself.

## Notes

- Most settings are profile-specific and stored in SharedPreferences
- The app uses MediaPipe for face detection (face_landmarker.task model)
- Accessibility service is required for system-wide gesture injection
- **Unused/Deprecated Components**: 
  - `CursorSpeed` - deprecated, replaced by `HeadBoardSettings` (still in manifest but functionality moved)
  - `HeadBoardService` and AIDL interfaces (`IHeadBoardService`, `IHeadBoardCallback`, `KeyInfo`, `KeyBounds`) - defined but not used in production code
  - `SwipePoint` (utils) - data class defined but never used
  - `ActionStatus` (utils) - enum defined but never used
  - `OpenBoardKeyCodes` (utils) - duplicate of `Config.kt`, not used (Config is used instead)
  - These appear to be experimental/prepared for future use or legacy code
- OpenBoard keyboard integration currently uses broadcast receivers (`KeyboardEventReceiver`) rather than AIDL
- Path cursor is an alternative cursor mode that follows a predicted path
